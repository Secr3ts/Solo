# Solo App

# Note:
  This Client is no longer maintained till [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com) adds a way to interact with their new api.

> A simple Soundcloud Desktop Client.

## Why ? 

I created this app because other apps (like [Auryo](https://github.com/Superjo149/auryo)) aren't supported / doesn't work very well.  
The purpose of this app is to give an nice UX experience, while enjoying *your* favorite musics since your cosy Desktop
